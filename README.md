Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics
===========================================

**SINDy** is a python 2.7 library for system identification problems. It is based on the original paper by Brunton *et al.* (Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems, *PNAS*, vol. **113** (15), pp. 3932--3937, 2016).
